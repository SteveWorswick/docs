# Telegram Integration

Connecting your Pandorabot to [Telegram](https://telegram.org/) could not be
easier! We've just released the
[pb-telegram](https://github.com/pandorabots/pb-telegram) package for a nearly
one-click deployment.

Start by sending a message to [@BotFather](https://core.telegram.org/bots) from
your personal Telegram account. The BotFather is a bot user that guides you
through the process of naming your bot, and retrieving your API token.

Once you've gotten your API token and gathered your Pandorabots API credentials,
just click the "Deploy to Heroku" button found in the repository's README.md
file. Enter your information to configure the application and click "Deploy for
Free".

When the application has launched, your Pandorabot will be available for chat to
Telegram users!

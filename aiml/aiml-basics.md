# Artificial Intelligence Markup Language \(AIML\)



**What is the difference between AIML and AIML 2.0?**

The AIML 2.0 specification introduces a number of new features to the language that dramatically improve the natural language processing power of chatbots. These features include:

* Zero+ Wildcards
* Highest Priority Matching
* Migration from XML attributes to tags
* AIML Sets
* AIML Maps
* Loops
* Local variables
* Sraix
* Denormalization
* Pandorabots Extensions
  * date
  * request
  * response
  * unbound predicates
  * learn
  * learnf
  * explode
* OOB \(Out of Band\) Tags

The new Pandorabots AIML interpreter is backwards compatible with AIML 1.0, so you can make full use of your old bot files. However, it does not currently support Javascript.

For more details, please read Dr. Richard Wallace's full[AIML 2.0 specification](https://docs.google.com/a/pandorabots.com/document/d/1wNT25hJRyupcG51aO89UcQEiG-HkXRXusukADpFnDs4/pub).

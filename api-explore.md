Steps to Basic Bot Deployment:  
1\) [Create a bot](https://developer.pandorabots.com/docs#!/pandorabots_api_swagger_1_3/createBot)  
2\) Upload bot file\(s\)\*\*  
3\) [Compile bot](https://developer.pandorabots.com/docs#!/pandorabots_api_swagger_1_3/compileBot)  
4\) [Talk to your bot](https://developer.pandorabots.com/docs#!/pandorabots_api_swagger_1_3/talkBot)  


\*\*NOTE: The current standard of open source Swagger.js has a bug causing a problem with file upload. There is a current workaround implemented; if you want to use this interface for uploading a file, you will need to copy the file content into the input field. For file upload, we recommend using our own [CLI](https://medium.com/pandorabots-blog/introducing-the-pandorabots-cli-215ed9d637af) or a REST client of your choice \(e.g. Postman Chrome extension\).

# Why Pandorabots

Recently, there has been a tremendous amount of hype around chatbots, such that it has become difficult to filter the signal from the noise. Before you choose your chatbot vendor, it's important to understand the pros and cons to a variety of technical approaches to the very hard AI problem that is Natural Language Understanding, and what differentiates Pandorabots.

###### Market Tested

Pandorabots has been in business since 2008. Our visionary founders are "Original Gangsters" when it comes to chatbots, and the platform has survived several hype cycles \(yes, bots existed prior to 2015 when Facebook opened the Messenger platform - in fact, the technology originated back in the 1960s\). Over a quarter of a million developers and business - including top global brands - have registered for and used our platform since inception. It is a market-tested, production ready solution that works.

Back in 2015, Pandorabots was one of only a few chatbot platforms. Today, there are hundreds, but that number has peaked \(along with the hype cycle\) and will increasingly decrease, as startups fail to monetize or raise their next round, and get acquihired or shutter their offering. Building on a startup that isn't market tested is very risky!

Keep in mind that building a robust conversational agent in a _long term investment_. Even if you have a ton of training data such that machine learning methods may be effective, machine learning \(and deep learning and other AI buzz words\) aren't a silver bullet when it comes to Natural Language Processing. It is important to deploy a chatbot early, collect data, and constantly improve the system - and for this reason, it is important to select a vendor that has been around and will be around for a while.

###### Breadth and Depth of Experience

Pandorabots offers the widest possible range of solutions, from the free, DIY \(a.k.a. build it yourself\) platform offering to fully turnkey chatbot and application development \(available to larger enterprises\). This allows everyone, from individual hobbyists to big brands, to build a successful chatbot strategy based on internal resources available and outsource as needed.

###### Open Standards Based, Open System

Not a black box

Extensible

Machine learning based systems and APIs \(like Watson, api.ai, wit.ai, etc.\) are black boxes. In theory, the user can provide sample inputs, and the correct response, and the system can then identify inputs that are similar to the sample inputs and learn that these map to the same response. In reality, these systems are not effective without a large amount of training data, and it is not possible to debug the system when it returns the wrong answer.

When it comes to these systems, you, the user, do not own your data, and you do not own the code for your chatbot. Your data is being fed into a third party system that dictates what input is returned, and why. From the perspective of a large brand, returning a "learned" input from a machine rather than trained copywriters on staff would be disastrous! 

These ML-based systems have another problem: performance. Above approximately ~500 defined intents, the systems begin to slow way down. By contrast, the response time for bots hosted on Pandorabots is always around ~300 milliseconds, even for bots that have ~300,000 intents defined. For finite domains, a botmaster may not need to define over 500 intents, but generally speaking robust chatbots have a lot more intents defined, and that number should only increase over time.

###### Easy\(ish\) to Learn

Building a good bot is hard. You can't build anything good in 5 minutes. Trend to button-based, but that is a stop gap.

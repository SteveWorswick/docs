Welcome to [Pandorabots](https://www.pandorabots.com)! We offer an online web service for building and deploying _chatbots_.

**What is a chatbot?**

A chatbot \(or bot\) is a conversational software program designed to chat with humans via voice or text.

Chatbots can be deployed in a variety of channels including popular voice and messaging platforms. The use cases are virtually endless, from automating common customer service queries, to providing touch points along the customer journey, to optimizing internal IT processes, to learning applications like language and enterprise soft skills, to games, toys, entertainment, and more.

Over 300,000 chatbots have been built on the Pandorabots platform to date. Our goal is to provide the tools you need to let your imagination and your bots run wild! We also provide Professional Services including custom chatbot development for top global brands and larger enterprises, but this documentation should contain all the resources you need to build your own DIY bot.

The Pandorabots platform supports an open standard scripting language called _Artificial Intelligence Markup Language_ \(_AIML\)_.

**What is AIML?**

AIML is XML-based and easy for anyone to learn, even if you aren't a programmer. Despite its deliberate simplicity, the language powers the most complex conversational agents on the market to date, including the multi award-winning [Mitsuku chatbot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitsuku). Mitsuku is widely considered the best AI conversationalist and can be accessed on [Messenger](https://www.messenger.com/t/47719737069), Kik, Telegram, [Twitch](https://go.twitch.tv/mitsuku_irl), or the [web](http://www.mitsuku.com/).

The easiest way to get started with AIML is to [create a Pandorabots account](https://www.pandorabots.com) and then spend five minutes on the interactive [Quickstart](/building-bots/quickstart.md), which will walk you through both chatbot development and user interface fundamentals. For a deeper dive, [Bot Building 101](/building-bots/tutorial-building-bots-on-the-pandorabots-platform.md) is an excellent starting point, and there are a wealth of additional AIML resources in the AIML section.

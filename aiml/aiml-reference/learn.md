### &lt;learn&gt;

The *learn element* allows the user to generate new category blocks from within a conversation. This powerful introduced in AIML 2.0 allows users to actually teach the bot new information.

Categories generated by the learn element are stored in memory, and are only accessible with the `client_name` that was used to create them.

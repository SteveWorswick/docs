## Core Concepts

Bot Development consists of a relationship between the following three entities: 

* _**chatbot\(n.\) or bot\(n.\)**_** - **a computer program designed to simulate conversation with a human end-user via voice or textual inputs

* _**botmaster\(n.\)**_** - **a person who creates, develops, and maintains the code and content that make up a chatbot

* _**client\(n.\) **_**- **a person chatting with a bot

The Pandorabots Platform is a feature-rich user interface designed to help you, the botmaster, create AIML-based chatbots.

* _**AIML\(n.\) **_**- **Artificial Intelligence Markup Language: the simple open standard language in which Pandorabots are written

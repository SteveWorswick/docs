# The Pandorabots CLI {#the-pandorabots-cli}

While we offer a number of opensource SDKs and tools for working with the Pandorabots API, we highly recommend using the [Pandorabots CLI](https://github.com/pandorabots/pb-cli). This tool is designed to let you manage and interact with your bots straight from the command line.

## Why is this great? {#why-is-this-great}

Of course, you could use an HTTP client like cURL to talk to the API. For example, to upload a file via cURL:

~~~
$ curl -v -X PUT 'https://aiaas.pandorabots.com/bot/APP_ID/BOTNAME/file/example.aiml?user_key=USER_KEY'
  --data-binary @/home/mybot/example.aiml
~~~

That’s a lineful! Wouldn’t it be better if you could just freely type the commands, without worrying about all the necessary parameters to format a request?

This is exactly what we’ve done with the CLI:

~~~
$ pb upload example.aiml
~~~

The CLI offers an easy and slick interface for doing all the things you’ll need to create, update, and maintain your chatbots.

## Installation {#installation}

The CLI itself is written in Javascript, so you’ll need to setup node.js on your machine before you can install it. Luckily, node.js offers a number of[installers](http://nodejs.org/download/)for OS X and Windows users to make this very easy. You can also download binaries for Linux, or build yourself from the source code.

Node.js comes prepackaged with[npm](http://npmjs.org/), which is a Javascript package manager that has an extremely vibrant community of modules and users. You can install the CLI using the`npm`command:

~~~
$ npm install -g pb-cli
~~~

This will install the CLI globally to your machine, making the`pb`and`pandorabots`commands now available use in your command line.

## Configuration {#configuration}

The CLI introduces the concept of configuration files, which allow you to freely type commands as shown above. The configuration file is a JSON file called`chatbot.json`. It stores basic information about your application:

~~~
{
  "app_id": "********",
  "user_key": "******",
  "botname": "*******"
}
~~~

When you run a a CLI command, it will look in the current directory for the`chatbot.json`file. If it finds one, it will automatically add the necessary information to you call. You can create this file from scratch, or, run the`init`command to let the CLI build it for you. This command will prompt you for all the necessary information:

~~~
$ pb init
~~~

## Usage {#usage}

Once you have created a`chatbot.json`file, you can begin running all sorts of commands you might expect us to offer for the Pandorabots API:

~~~
$ pb create
$ pb upload example.aiml
$ pb compile
$ pb talk Hello world!
~~~

The CLI offers some additional tools not available through our REST API, such as the ability to upload multiple files at once:

~~~
$ pb push
~~~

## Next Steps {#further-information}

Take a look at the CLI on [Github](https://github.com/pandorabots/pb-cli) for a complete list of the commands available. Please fork the project or report any issues or suggestions you may have!
